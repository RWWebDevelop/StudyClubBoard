#SimpleJavaServer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simple server written in Java based on the popular NanoHTTPD server project (https://github.com/nanohttpd/nanohttpd). We'll used to test the performance of our study club website. 

__TODO: We'll try to refactor the code and maybe add additional functions in the future.__
