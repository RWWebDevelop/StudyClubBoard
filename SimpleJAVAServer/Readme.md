#SimpleJavaServer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simple server written in Java based on the popular NanoHTTPD server project (https://github.com/nanohttpd/nanohttpd). We'll used to test the performance of our study club website. 

__HOW TO RUN:__   
1. install Java Runtime Environment (version >= 8):   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html   
2. Run the file __run.bat__.   
3. Open and type ___http://your.ip.address:port___ in your browser.   
4. And you can access the server.   

__Realese Notes:__   
_2016-04-12 - first version release!_    
_2016-04-13 - code refactor, fix the file upload issue and the post message can point to server IP address._    

__TODO: We'll try to refactor the code and maybe add additional functions in the future.__
